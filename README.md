# Hi there! I'm Shalanah!

I enjoy anticipating users needs by designing digital products and coding interactive web apps. I work with JS, React, Node, MongoDB, AWS, Python, CSS, SVG, Canvas, Figma, Photoshop, Illustrator, and InDesign.

## Formerly @WHCC

## For Fun

I love art, math, coding, and [playing broomball](https://youtu.be/jXegEec5dC8?t=1973).

## Side Projects

<h3><img src="https://github.com/shalanah/shalanah/blob/master/projects/spiral-betty.png" height="24"/> Spiral Betty</h3>

Apply a spiral filter to your images with <a href="https://spiralbetty.com">Spiral Betty</a>. Spiral Betty went viral on <a href="https://tiktok.com/tag/spiralbetty">TikTok tagged #spiralbetty</a> and has more than 64M video views.

<h3><img src="https://github.com/shalanah/shalanah/blob/master/projects/kind-cloud2.png" height="20"/> Kind Cloud</h3>

Grab your yoga mat and center yourself with this loving-kindness meditation app <a href="https://kindcloud.app">Kind Cloud</a>.

<h3><img src="https://github.com/shalanah/shalanah/blob/master/projects/where-does-the-squirrel-sleep.png" height="22"/> Where Does the Squirrel Sleep?</h3>

Read <a href="https://wheredoesthesquirrelsleep.com">Where Does the Squirrel Sleep?</a> before bedtime to little ones. It's an empathy building story about where different animals sleep. Grant Dawson, my husband, wrote the book, Nathan Stromberg created the delightful artwork, and I did book layout and created a landing page for it.

<h3><img src="https://github.com/shalanah/shalanah/blob/master/projects/baseline.png" height="24"/> Text Experiments</h3>

Get more control of web text with a brand new method to create <a href="https://github.com/shalanah/baseline">leading on the web</a> and find the [first character of each line](https://github.com/shalanah/block-wrap-breaks) in a block of text.

<h3><img src="https://github.com/shalanah/shalanah/blob/master/projects/talks.png" height="20"/> Talks</h3>

Hear me <a href="https://github.com/shalanah/talks">talk</a> around the Twin Cities about side projects, text in the browser, React, or hand-coding SVGs.
