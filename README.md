## About Me

Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Shalanah, a senior software engineer. I develop interactive tools that empower users to craft everything from photo albums and paper snowflakes to educational resources and solar panel designs. Although I've done work that touches the whole stack, user interfaces are my true love.
