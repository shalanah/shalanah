# Hi there! I'm Shalanah!
I enjoy creating interactive web apps. I mostly work with JS, React, CSS, SVG, and Canvas.

## For fun...

I love art, math, coding, and [playing broomball](https://youtu.be/jXegEec5dC8?t=1973).

## Projects

Apply a spiral filter to your images with [Spiral Betty](https://spiralbetty.com). You can even print off in ["coloring book mode"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_rV4uJDW3l8) and color in yourself!

Read [Where Does the Squirrel Sleep?](https://wheredoesthesquirrelsleep.com) before bedtime to little ones. It's an empathy building story about where different animals sleep. Grant, my husband, wrote the book, Nathan Stromberg created the delightful artwork, and I did book layout and created a landing page for it.

Get more control of web text with new methods to [create leading on the web](https://github.com/shalanah/baseline) and finding the [first character in each line of a block of text](https://github.com/shalanah/block-wrap-breaks).

Hear me [talk](https://github.com/shalanah/talks) around the Twin Cities about side projects, text in the browser, React, or hand-coding SVGs.
