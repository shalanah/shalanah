## Hi there! I'm Shalanah!
I am a frontend engineer with a knack and enthusiasm for exploring new technologies while ensuring that design is user-friendly. Never shy to take on new challenges, I love problem solving and working with other developers.

## @WHCC
Lead development of our Card, Album, and Simple editors to help photographers craft printed products. 

## For fun...

I love art, math, coding and [playing broomball](https://youtu.be/jXegEec5dC8?t=1973).
