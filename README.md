## About Me

Hi there! 👋 I'm Shalanah, a software engineer specializing in frontend development and design. I've focused on interactive editors to help users create photo albums, holiday cards, photo filters, math lessons, and solar panel systems. Although my passion lies in user interfaces, I've also worked with Node, Python, AWS, Firebase Functions, and MongoDB. Currently, I'm on a self-funded sabbatical giving talks and experimenting with ThreeJS, Blender, R3F, NextJS, and Rive.app.
