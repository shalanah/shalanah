# Hi there! I'm Shalanah!

I enjoy creating interactive web apps. I mostly work with JS, React, CSS, SVG, and Canvas.

## @WHCC

Lead development of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gs2CZlUXrCo"><img src="https://github.com/shalanah/shalanah/blob/master/projects/whcc-card.png" height="24"/> Card</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjctUy61XSo"><img src="https://github.com/shalanah/shalanah/blob/master/projects/whcc-album.png" height="26"/> Album</a>, and <img src="https://github.com/shalanah/shalanah/blob/master/projects/whcc-simple.png" height="22"/> Simple Editors to help photographers create printed products.

## For fun...

I love art, math, coding, and [playing broomball](https://youtu.be/jXegEec5dC8?t=1973).

## Projects

Apply a spiral filter to your images with <a href="https://spiralbetty.com"><img src="https://github.com/shalanah/shalanah/blob/master/projects/spiral-betty.png" height="24"/> Spiral Betty</a>. You can even print off in ["coloring book mode"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_rV4uJDW3l8) and color in yourself!

Grab your yoga mat and center yourself with this loving-kindness meditation app <a href="https://kindcloud.app"><img src="https://github.com/shalanah/shalanah/blob/master/projects/kind-cloud2.png" height="22"/> Kind Cloud</a>.

Read <a href="https://wheredoesthesquirrelsleep.com"><img src="https://github.com/shalanah/shalanah/blob/master/projects/where-does-the-squirrel-sleep.png" height="22"/> Where Does the Squirrel Sleep?</a> before bedtime to little ones. It's an empathy building story about where different animals sleep. Grant, my husband, wrote the book, Nathan Stromberg created the delightful artwork, and I did book layout and created a landing page for it.

Get more control of web text with new methods to create <a href="https://github.com/shalanah/baseline"><img src="https://github.com/shalanah/shalanah/blob/master/projects/baseline.png" height="24"/> leading on the web</a> and to find the [first character of each line](https://github.com/shalanah/block-wrap-breaks) in a block of text.

Hear me <a href="https://github.com/shalanah/talks"><img src="https://github.com/shalanah/shalanah/blob/master/projects/talks.png" height="20"/> talk</a> around the Twin Cities about side projects, text in the browser, React, or hand-coding SVGs.
