## About Me

I develop interactive tools that help users craft everything from <a href="https://shalanah.com/snowflake">paper snowflakes</a> and <a href="https://shalanah.com/whcc">photo albums</a> to <a href="https://shalanah.com/mathigon">educational resources</a> and <a href="https://shalanah.com/scanifly">solar panel designs</a>. 

Although I've done work that touches the whole stack, user interfaces are my true love.

I craft digital products at [Livefront](https://livefront.com) in Minneapolis, MN.
